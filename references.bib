  abstract     = {Four methods for deriving partial atomic charges from the
                  quantum chemical electrostatic potential (CHELP, CHELPG,
                  Merz-Kollman, and RESP) have been compared and critically
                  evaluated. It is shown that charges strongly depend on how and
                  where the potential points are selected. Two alternative
                  methods are suggested to avoid the arbitrariness in the
                  point-selection schemes and van der Waals exclusion radii:
                  CHELP-BOW, which also estimates the charges from the
                  electrostatic potential, but with potential points that are
                  Boltzmann-weighted after their occurrence in actual
                  simulations using the energy function of the program in which
                  the charges will be used, and CHELMO, which estimates the
                  charges directly from the electrostatic multipole
                  moments. Different criteria for the quality of the charges are
                  discussed.},
